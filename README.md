DESCRIPTION: Ensuring the safety and integrity of database data is crucial for any organization. This document outlines the backup and recovery process for the CodTech database, providing step-by-step instructions for database administrators to safeguard data and restore it in case of accidental deletion or system failures. To maintain an effective backup and recovery strategy, several best practices should be followed. Automating backups through scripts or scheduled tasks ensures that recent copies of the data are always available. Regular verification of backup files by restoring them in a separate environment helps confirm their integrity and usability. Storing backups in off-site locations, such as cloud services like AWS S3 or Google Drive, provides additional protection against hardware failures or cyber threats. Monitoring and logging backup activities enable administrators to track failures and take corrective action if needed. Furthermore, restricting access to backup and restore operations ensures data security by preventing unauthorized modifications
